This extension does a simple group of regex on the text components of your page 
when loaded. For text found looking like WG21 issue numbers or paper numbers, a
link to https://wg21.link/ is generated for the corresponding issue or paper.

The plugin will also search for stable names and redirect to the current working
draft for such, via http://eel.is/c++draft

To run the extension from this directory, enable developer mode in chrome and 
load unpacked extension from the extensions page. Select this directory, and 
you should be ready to go.
